## What is Regex?

Definition: A regular expression, or "regex", is a group of characters or symbols which is used to find a specific pattern in a text.

A regular expression is a pattern that is matched against a subject string from left to right. Regular expressions are used to replace text within a string, validate forms, extract a substring from a string based on a pattern match, and so much more. The term "regular expression" is a mouthful, so you will usually find the term abbreviated to "regex" or "regexp".
